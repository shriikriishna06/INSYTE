# 💡HOW IT WORKS
1. User uploads CSV of reviews.
2. Backend sends it to AI (an API call is initiated to GEMINI API).
3. Each review returns :(JSON FILE)<br>
    {<br>
     &ensp;sentiment : " ... ",<br>
     &ensp;confidence : " ... ",<br>
     &ensp;summary : " ... "<br>
   }<br>
4. Factors are robustly mapped.(factor parameters are hard coded)
5.  Insights are aggregated and displayed with beautification.

# 💻TECH STACK
## BACKEND
- Python
- fastAPI
- Google Gemini API
- Robust Schema validation
## FRONTEND
- HTML
- Tailwind CSS
- JS

# ⚙️RUN IT LOCALLY
1. Clone repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shriikriishna06/insyte.git
cd insyte
```
2. Install backend deps
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Creation of .env
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```
4. Start backend service
```bash
python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
```
5. Go live on<br>
Make sure to set the right path for the assets and js to get served. (using python(fastAPI) to serve the front end is recommended)
```
insyte/frontend/landingpage.html
```
6. Using py to serve the frontend
- Place this API endpoints in the beginning of the main.py file.
```python
frontend_dir = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1] / "frontend" / "public"

@app.get("/")
def root():
    return FileResponse(frontend_dir / "landingpage.html")
```
- Place this at the end of main.py file.
```python
app.mount(
    "/",
    StaticFiles(directory=str(frontend_dir)),
    name="static"
)
```

# 🛡️RELIABILITY
- Strict JSON validation
- AI hallucination protection
- Confidence calibration system
- Graceful fallback handling
- Safe batching to avoid failures

# 📄CSV FORMAT
No headers required. Cleaning, parsing ->Insyte handles it all.
Sample format:
```
Product quality is amazing but delivery was late
Customer support helped me quickly
App crashes often
```
# ✅️STATUS
This project is currently:
- Working end to end
- SaaS ready architecture
- Business reliable insights
## 🎯FUTURE PLAN
- Integration of USER accounts.(firebase, OAUTH etc)
- Saved history on the server side using persistent db.(currently using browser local storage still persistent after browser reopen)
- Visual Insights
- Insight export (PDF)
- Dockerization (devops)
- Integrating Redis and Cloudflare for rate limiting and security concerns(DDOS)
